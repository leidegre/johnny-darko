# My personal "high contrast" dark theme

* Less clutter, I don't want my code to look like a rainbow colored christmas tree.
* Punctuation are dimmed
* Types are cyan
* Constants are green
* Parameters have a green-ish hue to emphasize that they should be treated as immutable
* Names standout

**Enjoy!**
